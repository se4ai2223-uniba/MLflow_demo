# MLflow demo for the SE4AI 2022-23 course

This is a demo ML project used to show the main features of [MLflow](https://mlflow.org) in the second edition of the "Software Engineering for AI-enabled Systems" course (University of Bari, Italy - Dept. of Computer Science).

The scripts used in this project are freely inspired by the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) Tutorial ["Intermediate Machine Learning"](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning). Accordingly, the example uses data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).

## Project setup
